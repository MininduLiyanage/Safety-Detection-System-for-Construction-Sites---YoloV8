# Safety-Detection-System-for-Construction-Sites---YoloV8-OpenCV
This project focuses on detecting safety measures in a construction site using computer vision techniques. It identifies whether workers and individuals are wearing safety vests, helmets, masks, and whether safety cones are placed correctly. Additionally, the system detects machinery, persons, and vehicles to ensure compliance with safety regulations.
